2. [【iOSDC2024】4. I tried making a slideshow using SwiftUI animations](https://ulog.sugiy.com/en/iosdc-swift-piano-slide-animation/)(English)

## This slide is made of SwiftUI
This application depends on [SlideKit](https://github.com/mtj0928/SlideKit) developed by [mtj0928](https://github.com/mtj0928).
So this slides contains a lot of animation expression using SwiftUI.
